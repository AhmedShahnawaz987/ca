                    Most businesses in India start individually without otherâ€™s
                    participation. An individual carrying out business
                    activities is the sole proprietor and its business entity is
                    said to be a Proprietorship Firm. The identity of an
                    individual and the business are not different from each
                    other. But due to the lower tax rate, flexibility and
                    multiple advantages people prefer this structure for the
                    early stage of business.
